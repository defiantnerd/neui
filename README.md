# neui
a modern and free UI framework - some day :)

## status
Currently, this is not usable as a library but serves as a playground to test ideas and develop the infrastructure of a modern UI system.

## goals
The goal is to develop a modern and free UI framework that is portable and cross platform and easy to use. It should benefit from existing platforms and behave platform specific to minimize the feeling of alienisation then comes along with approaches like electron etc. 
This includes using fonts, colors and sizes that are defined from the target system.

It is *NOT* an immediate GUI system since these are usually wasteful and involve high energy consumption.
